Puzzle Description:
#+begin_src 
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

*** Algorithm
- Read in a line
  - Parse out integers in the strings
  - Combine the string-values of the integers
  - Convert combined string of integers to integer types
  - Store integer on to a slice of integers
  - Repeat until all lines are processed
- Sum up the slice of integers
